# Water Quality Prediction Project 📊💧

## Overview 🌍
This project focuses on predicting water quality parameters using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various water quality measurements such as NH4, BSK5, Suspended particles, O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4, and CL, collected over multiple years from different locations. The goal is to build a predictive model to forecast these parameters, aiding in water quality monitoring and management.

## Project Steps 🛠️

### 1. Installation of Libraries 📦
The necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are installed:
```python
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 2. Data Loading and Exploration 🔍
- The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.
- Basic exploration includes checking the structure, missing values, and statistical summaries.

### 3. Data Preprocessing 🧹
- **Date Conversion**: The `date` column is converted to a datetime format.
- **Feature Engineering**: New features like `year` and `month` are extracted from the `date` column.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are addressed (e.g., imputation or removal).

### 4. Data Visualization 📈
- Visualizations (e.g., histograms, time series plots) are created to understand the distribution and trends of water quality parameters.

### 5. Model Building 🤖
- **Multi-output Regression**: Used to predict multiple water quality parameters simultaneously.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: A robust model for handling non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 6. Model Evaluation 📉
- **Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) are used to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Predicted vs. actual values are plotted to assess model accuracy.
